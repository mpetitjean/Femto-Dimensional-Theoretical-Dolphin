This report presents the derivation and implementation of a two dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for the resolution of the Maxwell equations. 

First, the Maxwell equations are discretized in order to obtain implementable update equations for the fields. Then advanced boundary conditions are discussed in order to avoid reflections on the borders of the grid. Finally, the C source codes are shown, their functioning is detailed and a validation procedure is carried out.

These codes were used to illustrate the main concepts of electromagnetism presented in the Communication Channels course at the Brussels Faculty of Engineering. The derivation of the equations as well as the codes are based on the works of John Schneider\footnote{Understanding the FDTD method: \url{http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/}\label{fn}}.
